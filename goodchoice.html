    <p style="font-size: 30px; font-weight: bolder;font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;color: white;margin-top: 10%;">You have chosen to save the people.Often times it can be difficult if not impossible to make what you think at that moment will be the right choice. One of the biggest factors that will hold people back is that to too often than not we are not completely clear on what type of result or outcome we want from a situation. You've taken a good choice choice and you're a very selfless person. This distinguishes you from the other people.Good Job!! </p>
